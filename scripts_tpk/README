Introduction
----------------------------------------------
   This test suite is for Web Application Security & Privacy module testing.


----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Run the cases as "root" user.


----------------------------------------------
Installation
----------------------------------------------
./autogen
./configure prefix=/usr
make && make install


----------------------------------------------
Build and Run
----------------------------------------------
(Suppose you only get the source code which has been set up on your test device.
 If you have obtained tct-sp02-wrt-tests RPM packages, you can go directly  to step 3 on the test device)

Steps:
    1. Prepare for building:
       cd tct-sp02-wrt-tests
    2. Build RPM packages:
       ./pack.sh -t all
    3. Install RPM on the test device:
       rpm -ivh tct-sp02-wrt-tests-<version>-<release>.<arch>.rpm
    4. Prepare to install widget application on the device:
       cd /opt/tct-sp02-wrt-tests/
    5. Install WGT on the test device:
       pkgcmd -i -t wgt -q -p **.wgt
    6. Check the widget info when the widget has been installed:
       wrt-launcher -l
    7. Launch the widget:
       wrt-launcher -s <Application id>
    8. Uninstall WGT from the test device:
       pkgcmd -u -q -t wgt -n <application id>


----------------------------------------------
